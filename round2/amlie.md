# Chrome Extension Idea: Amazon Review Summarizer - Round 2

## Authors

Anders Amlie, Juno Kim

## Problem Statement

Since online goods are inherently harder to judge than when in-person shopping, reviews from actual people who bought the product are extremely important. Still, Amazon places these reviews at the absolute bottom of their long, clunky product pages. These reviews are both hard to navigate to and digest: they’re long, un-proofread pieces of text – this extension solves both by offering a cohesive pros and cons summary of a product in the click of a button.

## Target Audience

Online shoppers
People doing quick product comparisons
Mobile-first or accessibility-focused users
Tech-savvy consumers looking for faster decision-making

## Description

When on an Amazon product page, the extension scrapes the page of reviews, sends the text to GPT, and returns a clean, easy-to-read summary highlighting the most common pros and cons of the product. Results are shown in a popup or sidebar UI, triggered by clicking the extension icon.

## Selling Points

1. AI-powered Summarization – Fast, GPT-generated review summaries using actual customer feedback
2. Saves Time – No need to scroll through dozens of reviews – get the highlights instantly
3. Better Decision-Making – Balanced view of product strengths and weaknesses
4. Seamless Integration – Works directly on Amazon pages with one click
5. Lightweight & Private – No account needed, no tracking, just helpful summaries

## Notes

Challenge: Avoid being blocked by rate-limiting if scraping too many reviews

Consideration: Could be extended to other review-heavy platforms like Yelp, eBay, or BestBuy later on

UI Ideas: Use a minimal sidebar, tooltip, or bottom card for the summary output. Match Amazon’s color scheme for seamless UX
