# Chrome Extension Idea: Acamdeic Dictionary+

## Authors

Liam Kiernan, Gordon Chen, Immanuel Anaborne, Joyce Chen

## Problem Statement

A reader who reads academic papers and does not know what every concept means will suffer from confusion throughout the
paper and might not understand the authors use of terms even if the concept is relatively easy to understand.

## Target Audience

Students, or anybody who reads heavy or academic writing.

## Description

This will be a chrome extension that works by defining any word you highlight, but not through just a dictionary definition
but an actual fleshed out, but reasonably summarized explanation of like a possibly complex topic.
 
## Selling Points

1. Acdemic papers are often only difficult to read because of the use of complex language
2. Would reduce certain barriers to entry for education, like prior experience.
3. Makes any reading more accesible.
4. Ensures you do not have to have a lot of tabs open to constantly look up definitions
5. Makes reading a paper or anything dense more fluid and quicker to get through.

## User Stories

### 1. Highlight to Define
**As a user**, I want to highlight a word or phrase and get a popup explanation so that I can quickly understand unfamiliar terms in academic texts.

### 2. Context-Aware Explanations
**As a user**, I want the extension to give an explanation that reflects the academic context of the term (e.g., economics vs. philosophy), so that the meaning is relevant to the text I'm reading.

### 6. Domain Tagging
**As a user**, I want each explanation to be tagged with its academic domain (e.g., biology, law, sociology), so I know the disciplinary lens it's coming from.

### 7. Highlight Support for Phrases
**As a user**, I want to highlight multi-word phrases (e.g., "marginal utility", "social contract theory") and get a full explanation, not just word-by-word definitions.

### 12. Dark Mode Support
**As a user**, I want the extension interface to support dark mode so it’s comfortable for reading at night or in low-light settings.

### 13. Keyboard Shortcut Activation
**As a user**, I want to use a keyboard shortcut to instantly trigger the explanation popup after highlighting a term, so I don't have to use the mouse.
