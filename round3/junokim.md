# Chrome Extension Idea: **Amazon Review Summarizer**  
*Anders Amlie, Juno Kim, Anish Agrawal*

## Problem Statement
Online goods are harder to judge than items seen in‑person, so **reviews are critical**. Unfortunately, Amazon buries them at the bottom of long pages, and the reviews themselves are lengthy and un‑proofread. This extension provides a one‑click, cohesive **pros & cons** summary to solve both problems.

## Target Audience
- Online shoppers  
- People doing quick product comparisons  
- Mobile‑first or accessibility‑focused users  
- Tech‑savvy consumers seeking faster decisions  

---

## Description
When you land on an Amazon product page, the extension:

1. **Scrapes** the customer‑review section.  
2. **Sends** that text to GPT.  
3. **Returns** an easy‑to‑read summary of the most common pros and cons.  

The results appear in a popup or sidebar, triggered by clicking the extension icon.
